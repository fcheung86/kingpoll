      <div class='header'>How does this work?</div>
      <p>Coke or Pepsi? Cat or dog? Do aliens exist? Fold or crumple? Want to know if you're part of an elite minority with special preferences? You're in the right place.</p>
      <p>You see a poll, you vote. Don't see a poll? Make one. Don't want people knowing what you've voted? Vote anonymously. Only show what you want to show.</p>
      <div class='header'>Anonymous?</div>
      <p>Yeah. ANONYMOUS. Signing up is annoying; I don't want to ruin your fun. Just vote; your votes are cool. All you need to do is to provide an email for your vote verification.</p>
      <div class='header'>What. That's not anonymous!</div>
      <p>Haha! Tricked you! Just joking. I need your email to make sure you're human. I don't want bots messing up the polls. When you vote, the site sends you an e-mail with a random time limit. If you verify you're human by clicking on the link in the e-mail, your vote stays permanent. If you don't make the time limit, your vote is <strong>deleted</strong>.</p>
      <p>I will <strong>NEVER</strong> give out your e-mail to anyone. That's not cool. I just need it to keep the results as accurate as possible. I do encourage you to sign up though, because it helps us get more accurate results, and you also get a bunch of goodies as you progress your account.</p>
      <div class='header'>I'll just make more e-mails!</div>
      <p>I use a number of other ways to try and keep polls accurate. I can't say it's 100%, because really, how can I track <strong>anonymous</strong> voting with 100% accuracy? (Don't say cookies, you can exploit that). I don't have any information from you to differentiate the votes accurately. It's part of the pro's and con's game of privacy vs. accurate tracking. However, I promise to try and make it as accurate as possible so you can, with high accuracy, prove to your friends that <strong>the toilet paper should roll out from the top, not the bottom</strong>.</p>
      <div class='header'>Cool. What can I do?</div>
      <p>Like. To help me? Just vote normally. Go crazy and ask or answer as many questions as you want. Don't try to skew the results and just <strong>have fun</strong>.</p>
      <div class='header'>Uh no. What can I do on this site?</div>
      <p style="padding-bottom:0; margin-bottom:0">OH. So let's start with why I made this site: I'm a curious person. Humans are curious by nature. Questions -- sometimes trivial, sometimes hypothetical -- would arise within my social circle and arguments over what's better, would surely follow.</p>
      <p>What if you could quickly and easily ask the world a crazy question and get an honest answer? Mindblasting. So how would you do this? Facebook? You can't just randomly add people and ask creepy questions. OK, so Twitter? You have like 9 followers, don't kid yourself. <strong>OK, why don't I just go to one of the million other survey sites out there?</strong> You can, but they care only about themselves. They make you sign up, pay for their services, or they give you a simple and free poll link, but you need to get it out there yourself. It's scary out there, and <strong>sometimes you don't want people knowing what you're thinking, but you so desperately want to know what others think</strong>. Oh man, that's deep.</p>
      <p>Then comes along this site. Ask what you want; let your thoughts run wild and free. You're behind a veil of anonymity; free from judgement, free from inconveniences, just free as you can be.</p>
      <div class='header'>You talk too much. TL;DR plz.</div>
      <p style='margin-bottom:0; padding-bottom:0'>OK OK. Here's a point-form summary:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Free private or public polls.</li>
          <li>Anonymous. If you want.</li>
          <li>Quick and easy. Did I mention fun?</li>
          <li>Ask anything you want. <em>ANYTHING</em>.</li>
          <li>Answers from the world.</li>
          <li>Use in any social network; just link to your poll.</li>
          <li>Statistics and demographics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Still not interested? Damnit, that was my best speech. Well, if I can't convince you to stay forever, at least try it out. Never hurts to try right? I don't know. <em>There's probably a poll for that</em>.</p>
